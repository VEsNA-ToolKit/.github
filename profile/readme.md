# VEsNA Toolkit

Welcome to the VEsNA Toolkit organization! Here you will find an ecosystem of software tool compliant with the Virtual Environments via Natural language Agents (VEsNA) vision.  
We believe that, in the Generative AI and metaverse era, agent's sociality should involve humans by design, and situatedness should take virtual reality into account. Hence, our vision of the next generation intelligent software agents involves cognition and reasoning abilities, natural language interaction, and virtual reality.  
To make our vision concrete, starting from 2022 we designed and developed VEsNA, an open source project freely available to the research community that seamlessly integrates cognition (via Jason/JaCaMo), natural language (via intention based chatbots and LLMs), and virtual reality (Unity, in the VEsNA release developed in 2022; Godot in the version you find here).
